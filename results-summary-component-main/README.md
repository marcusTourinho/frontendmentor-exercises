## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used to have some difficulty with the media query and here I had the opportunity to practice it the easy way.

Using the following code I was able to work with media query and practice responsive design:

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
  #component-container {
    display: block;
  }
}
```
